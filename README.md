# User Stories

- As a developer, I want the application to use the useState hook so that the userâ€™s interactions with the app are smooth and their data is managed effectively.
- As a developer, I want to use the useEffect hook to manage game time with setInterval, return a cleanup function, and use a dependency array so that the game runs efficiently and updates in real-time for the user.
- As a developer, I want to create separate files that return JSX instead of including all JSX within App.jsx so that the code is well-organized, making the app more maintainable and reliable for the user.
- As a user, I want the application to automatically update the game state every second so that I can see my progress and earned cookies in real-time, making the game more exciting and rewarding.
- As a developer, I want to use the .map() function to render lists of items efficiently so that the user can see dynamic content without performance issues.
- As a user, I want to purchase upgrades with my earned cookies to increase my cookies per second, making the gameplay more rewarding.

# Requirements

- Implement the useState hook.
- Use useEffect effectively.
- Return JSX from a source other than App.jsx, for example, by using components.
- Apply setInterval to execute periodic tasks within the application.
- Use the .map() function to render lists of items in the application dynamically.
- Use logic to manage the purchase and application of upgrade items within the game.
